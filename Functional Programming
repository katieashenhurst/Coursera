// In functional programming, data and functions that operate on it are clearly separated, not combined inside objects.

var currencyOne = 100;
var currencyTwo = 0;
var exchangeRate = 1.2;

function convertCurrency(amount, rate) {

console.log(currencyTwo);

//result will be 120 as 100 x 1.2 is 120
